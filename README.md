# <span style="color:navy"> NeoDocs </span>
An under construction Google Docs-like document editor that allows for NeoVim like searching in documents and tabs

* Made for applying my learning of React, Mongoose, Socket.io.

Currently not focusing on styling, just proper implementation of what I want the app to do (styling hopefully in the future. css is hard.)

## Some goals:

* Search bar (done)
* implement splitting
* better styling (hahahaha... :|)
* Add delete button (done)
* Implement db to create and save files (done)
* Make Login and Create User page (done)
* Socket context (done)
